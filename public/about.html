<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is James Northup and I am new in the world of web developement.  My ultimate goal is to grow into web 3.0 as it is a big part of my life.  I would like to contribute
  to various projects I am a part of.  To do this I will need to crawl before I can walk, so stick with me through this journey and I will
  document it here.
